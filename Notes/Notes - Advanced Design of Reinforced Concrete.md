# Advanced Design of Reinforced Concrete



### Chapter 1: Introduction, Materials and Properties



#### 1.1 Reinforced Concrete Structures

Reinforced concrete is the union of two materials, <u>plain concrete</u> and <u>steel bars</u>.

*<u>Plain concrete</u>* - possesses high compressive strength but little tensile strength.

*<u>Steel bars</u>* - embedded in the concrete which provides the needed tensile strength.

Steel bars are also often used in compression zone of concrete to provide an added compressive strength to the beam.



##### 1.1.1 Reasons why steel and concrete work readily:

1. Bond - prevents slip of the bars relative to concrete.
2. Proper concrete mixture - provides adequate impermeability against water and bar corrosion.
3. Similar rates of thermal expansion:
   1. Concrete - 0.000010 to 0.000013 $^\circ$C
   2. Steel - 0.000012 $^\circ$C

> Transverse cracks may appear near the steel bars in tension (unless prestressed), such cracks are expected.



#### 1.2 Plain Concrete

Plain concrete is made by mixing cement, fine aggregates, coarse aggregate, water and sometimes, admixtures.

The strength of concrete depends on many factors:

- proportion of the ingredients
- conditions of temperature
- moisture under which it is placed and cured



#### 1.3 Cement

Cement is a material that has adhesive and cohesive properties. These enables mineral fragments to bond and form a solid mass.

##### 1.3.1 Portland cement

- usual hydraulic cement used in reinforced concrete. Concrete used with this attains adequate strength at <u>**14 days**</u> so that forms can be removed and reaches its design strength at **<u>28 days</u>**.

##### Table 1.3.1 Types of Portland Cement

| Type | Uses                                                         |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I    | Ordinary construction, special properties are not desired    |
| II   | Ordinary construction, moderate sulfate resistance or moderate heat of hydration is desired |
| III  | When high early strength is desired                          |
| IV   | When low heat of hydration is desired                        |
| V    | When high sulfate resistance is desired                      |



#### 1.4 Aggregates

Occupies about 75% of the total volume of concrete. 

##### 1.4.1 Normal Weight Concrete

Normal stone aggregates makes the concrete weighs about $2,300 kgs/m^3$. Adding of steel reinforcement, unit weight of concrete for the purpose of calculation is $2,400 kgs/m^3$.

##### 1.4.2 Lightweight Structural Concrete

Lightweight concrete have aggregates made of expanded clays and shales and weighs about $1,120$ to $1,840 kgs/m^3$



#### 1.5 Admixtures

##### 1.5.1 Air Entraining Admixtures

Causes air in the form of bubble (about 1mm $\phi$) to form throughout the concrete to increase workability and resistance to deterioration.

##### 1.5.2 Accelerating Admixtures

Accelerate the rate of early age strength development.

##### 1.5.3 Water-reducing and Set-controlling Admixtures

Improve the fresh and hardening of concrete. This reduces the water cement ratio while decreasing the use of cement and increasing strength.

##### 1.5.4 Admixture for Flowing Concrete

Used in concrete with high volume placement such as slabs, mats and pavements.



#### 1.6 Compressive Strength

The strength of concrete is dependent on the mixture of cement, aggregates, water and sometimes admixtures. 

***<u>Reference Concrete Strength</u>*** - uniaxial compressive strength measured from cylinder compression tests.

The most important variable in determining concrete strength is the <u>water-cement ratio</u>. The lower the ratio, the higher the compressive strength.

Nearly all reinforced concrete behavior is related to the 28-days compressive strength, $f'c$. Note that this still depends on the size and shape of the test specimen. In normal weight concrete, in average, the 6 x 12in  cylinder is 80% of the 150-mm cube strength and 83% of the 200-mm cube strength.



#### 1.7 Tensile Strength

Tensile strength property of concrete greatly affects the size and extent of cracks in structures.

Test in this property is usually done using split-cylinder test by placing the cylinder on its side then applying the load. The split-cylinder test result has been found to be proportional to $\sqrt{f'c}$:

Modulus of rupture, $fct = 0.5\sqrt{f'c}$        to       $0.6\sqrt{f'c}$               (for normal weight concrete)  in $MPa$

Note that test result for modulus of rupture and the one calculated from $fr = \dfrac{Mc}{I}$ are different. The computed gives higher values due to compressive strength distribution is not linear when tensile failure is imminent. 



#### 1.8 Modulus of Elasticity

Modulus of elasticity of concrete varies with strength, unlike that of steel. For normal weight concrete, ACI-8.5.1 suggests
$$
Ec = 5,700\sqrt{f'c}
$$
where Ec is in psi, and roughly
$$
Ec = 4,700\sqrt{f'c}
$$
where Ec is in MPa (ACI 318-05M).

#### 1.9 Creep and Shrinkage

Properties of concrete that are hard to predict and is time-dependent. These becomes hard to predict because of inaccuracies and lots of unknown variables.

##### 1.9.1 Creep

Creep is the property by which a material continues to deform with time under sustained loading. Factors affecting creep are composition of cement, admixture and sizes of aggregates, water-cement ratio, closing of internal voids and flow of water out of cement during drying.

##### 1.9.2 Shrinkage

Volume change of concrete during hardening and curing. This may be controlled by continuously wetting or watering the structure during curing period.
